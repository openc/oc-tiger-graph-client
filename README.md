# RubyTigerGraphClient

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/ruby_tiger_graph_client`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'ruby_tiger_graph_client', "~> 0.1.0", git: "git@github.com:openc/ruby-tiger-graph-client.git"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby_tiger_graph_client

To run your tests you will need to set up a local Tigergraph environment. We have provided a spec file as an example.
